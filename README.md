# CPSC 473 - Front-End Engineering - Spring 2018
## Homework 3
### Section 02 - due March 5, Section 01 - due March 7

In this assignment, you will bring up the CoffeeRun app and experiment with using its FormHandler module to process data from a form submission.
Complete the following:
1. Work through Chapter 8 to create the DataStore and Truck modules. Add .eslintrc.js to your repository, and be sure to fix any errors found by ESLint.

As you create the modules, be sure to test them interactively in the DevTools Console, as in Figures 8.10 and 8.32. Keep in mind that you can recall previously executed code using the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard.

2. Complete Chapters 9 and 10 to create a form, style it with Bootstrap, and use jQuery to define a FormHandler object.
Read the MDN articles Your first HTML form and How to structure an HTML form, and create a new HTML file with the payment form from the end of the second article.

3. Now modify the payment form to load the FormHandler module and add a submit handler. (The default handler action of logging to the console is fine for this step, but we’ll enhance the handler in Step (6) below.)

4. Complete Chapter 11 to add the CheckList module to CoffeeRun and see how to create DOM elements with jQuery.

5. Add the jQuery Modal plugin to the page for the payment form you created in Step (4) above.

6. Modify the submit handler code to open a modal dialog box thanking the user for their payment, using the title and name values from the form (e.g., “Thank you for your payment, Ms. Ada Lovelace“).

7. Push the contents of your project to a new GitHub repository. Do not push this assignment to the same repository as your previous homework assignments.
